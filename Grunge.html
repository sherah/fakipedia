	    <p><b>Grunge</b> (sometimes referred to as the <b>Seattle sound</b>) is a subgenre of <a href="/wiki/Alternative_rock" title="Alternative rock">alternative rock</a> that emerged during the mid-1980s in the American state of <a href="/wiki/Washington_(state)" title="Washington (state)">Washington</a>, particularly in <a href="/wiki/Seattle" title="Seattle">Seattle</a>. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's <a href="/wiki/Independent_record_label" title="Independent record label">independent record label</a> <a href="/wiki/Sub_Pop" title="Sub Pop">Sub Pop</a>, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals.</p>
<p>Grunge became commercially successful in the first half of the 1990s, due mainly to the release of <a href="/wiki/Nirvana_(band)" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Nevermind" title="Nevermind">Nevermind</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Pearl_Jam" title="Pearl Jam">Pearl Jam</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Ten_(Pearl_Jam_album)" title="Ten (Pearl Jam album)">Ten</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Soundgarden" title="Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Badmotorfinger" title="Badmotorfinger">Badmotorfinger</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Alice_in_Chains" title="Alice in Chains">Alice in Chains</a>' <i><a href="/wiki/Dirt_(Alice_in_Chains_album)" title="Dirt (Alice in Chains album)">Dirt</a></i>, and <a href="/wiki/Stone_Temple_Pilots" title="Stone Temple Pilots">Stone Temple Pilots</a>' <i><a href="/wiki/Core_(Stone_Temple_Pilots_album)" title="Core (Stone Temple Pilots album)">Core</a></i>. The success of these bands boosted the popularity of alternative rock and made grunge the most popular form of <a href="/wiki/Hard_rock" title="Hard rock">hard rock</a> music at the time.<sup id="cite_ref-allmusic_grunge_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-allmusic_grunge-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Although most grunge bands had disbanded or faded from view by the late 1990s, their influence continues to affect modern rock music.</p>
<p>Often characterized by a sludgy guitar sound that uses a high level of distortion, <a href="/wiki/Distortion_(music)" title="Distortion (music)">fuzz</a> and <a href="/wiki/Audio_feedback" title="Audio feedback">feedback</a> effects, grunge fuses elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal, although some bands performed with more emphasis on one or the other. The music shares with punk a raw sound and similar lyrical concerns.<sup id="cite_ref-allmusic_grunge_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-allmusic_grunge-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> However, it also involves much slower <a href="/wiki/Tempo" title="Tempo">tempos</a>, <a href="/wiki/Consonance_and_dissonance" title="Consonance and dissonance">dissonant</a> harmonies, and more complex instrumentationâ€”which is reminiscent of heavy metal. Lyrics are typically angst-filled, often addressing themes such as <a href="/wiki/Social_alienation" title="Social alienation">social alienation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Apathy" title="Apathy">apathy</a>, confinement, and a desire for <a href="/wiki/Liberty" title="Liberty">freedom</a>.</p>
<p>Grunge bands had made inroads to the musical <a href="/wiki/Mainstream" title="Mainstream">mainstream</a> in the late 1980s. <a href="/wiki/Soundgarden" title="Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a> was the first grunge band to sign to a major label when they joined the roster of <a href="/wiki/A%26M_Records" title="A&amp;M Records">A&amp;M Records</a> in 1989. A number of factors contributed to grunge's decline in prominence. During the mid-1990s many grunge bands broke up or became less visible. Nirvana's <a href="/wiki/Kurt_Cobain" title="Kurt Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a>, labeled by <i>Time</i> as "the <a href="/wiki/John_Lennon" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> of the swinging Northwest", appeared unusually tortured by success and "struggled with an addiction to heroin before he committed suicide at the age of 27 in 1994".</p>
